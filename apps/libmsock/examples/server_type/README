Dump the header from the web server. In most cases you'll be able to tell the
type of the web server. Some people intentionally turn it off.

Example: 

    $ ./server_type http://www.yaoo.com/
    HTTP/1.0 200 OK
    MIME-Version: 1.0
    Date: Sat, 10 Jul 1999 17:36:38 GMT
    Server: NaviServer/2.0 AOLserver/2.3.3
    Content-Type: text/html
    Content-Length: 371
