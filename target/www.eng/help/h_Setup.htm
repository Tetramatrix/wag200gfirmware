<h1>Setup Tab / Basic Setup</h1><br>
<p>The <i>Basic Setup</i> screen you will see when accessing the Router. Most users will be able to configure the Router and get it working properly using only the settings on this screen. Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) will require that you enter specific information, such as User Name, Password, Internet IP Address, Default Gateway Address, or DNS Address. This information can be obtained from your ISP, if required.</p>

<p><b>Note: After you have configured these settings, you 
should set a new password for the Router using the <i>Management </i>
screen of the <i>Administration</i> tab. This will increase 
security by protecting the Router from unauthorized changes. All users 
who try to access the Router web-based utility or Setup Wizard 
will be prompted for the Router password.</b>

<p><b>RFC 2516 PPPoE</b> (For ADSL users)
<div class="morespace">
Some DSL-based ISPs use PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) to 
establish Internet Connections. If using PPPoE, your IP address is provided automatically, but the following data must be entered.
</div>

<ul>
<li><b>User Name and Password</b>

<li><b>Connect on Demand</b>
<div class="morespace">
You can configure the Router to disconnect your Internet 
connection after a specified period of inactivity (Max Idle 
Time). If your Internet connection has been terminated due to 
inactivity, Connect on Demand enables the Router to 
automatically re-establish your connection as soon as you 
attempt to access the Internet again. If you wish to activate 
Connect on Demand, click the radio button. In the  <i>Max Idle Time</i>
field, enter the number of minutes to elapse before an idle Internet 
connection is terminated.
</div></li>

<li><b>Keep Alive</b>
<div class="morespace">
This option keeps you connected to the Internet 
indefinitely, even when your connection sits idle. To use this 
option, click the radio button next to <i>Keep Alive</i>. The 
default <em>Redial Period</em> is 30 seconds. (In other words, the Router 
will check the Internet connection every 30 seconds, and re-establish
the connection if it does not exist.)

<p><b>RFC 2364 PPPoA</b>

Some of these settings may be required by your ISP.
Verify with your ISP before making any changes.

<p><b>Host Name and Domain Name</b>
<div class="morespace">
These fields allow you to supply a host and domain name for the Router. Some 
ISPs, usually cable ISPs, require these names as identification. 
You may have to check with your ISP to see if your broadband 
Internet service has been configured with a host and domain 
name. In most cases, leaving these fields blank will work.

<div class="morespace">
MTU is the Maximum Transmission Unit. It specifics the largest packet size 
permitted for Internet transmission. Select <b>Manual</b> if you 
want to manually enter the largest packet size that will be 
transmitted. The recommended size, entered in the <i>Size </i>

<td class="leftstyle" valign="top"><b>Network Address Server Settings (DHCP)</b></td>
<td class="rightstyle" valign="top">
These settings allow you to configure the Router Dynamic Host Configuration 
Protocol (DHCP) server function. The Router can be used as a 
DHCP server for your network. A DHCP server automatically 
assigns an IP address to each computer on your network. If you 
choose to enable the Router DHCP server option, you must make 
sure there is no other DHCP server on your network.

<p><b>DHCP Server</b>
<div class="morespace">
DHCP is enabled by factory default. 
<BR>If you already have a DHCP server on 
your network, or you don’t want a DHCP server, then select <b>
Disabled </b>(no other DHCP features will be available).
<BR>If you already have a DHCP server on 
your network, and you want this Router to act as a Relay for that DHCP Server, select <b>
DHCP Relay </b>, then enter the <b>DHCP Server</b> IP Address. 
</div>

<p><b>Start IP Address</b>
<div class="morespace">
Enter a value for the DHCP server to start with when issuing IP 
addresses. Because the Router default IP address is 
192.168.1.1, the Starting IP Address must be 192.168.1.2 or 
greater, but smaller than 192.168.1.254. The default Starting IP 
Address is <b>192.168.1.100</b>. 
</div>

<p><b>Maximum Number of DHCP Users</b>
<div class="morespace">
Enter the maximum number of PCs that you want the DHCP server to assign IP 
addresses to. This number cannot be greater than 253. The 
default is <b>50</b>.
</div>

<p><b>Client Lease Time</b>
<div class="morespace">
The Client Lease Time is the amount of time a network user will be allowed 
connection to the Router with their current dynamic IP address. 
Enter the amount of time, in minutes, that the user will be leased this dynamic 
IP address. After the time is up, the user will be automatically 
assigned a new dynamic IP address. The default is 0 minutes, which means one day.
</div>

<p><b>Static DNS (Domain Name Server) 1~3</b>
<div class="morespace">
Every time a PC reboots, it is assigned a new local IP address 
by the Router. If you want a PC to be assigned the same IP 
address every time it reboots, then enter the <b>Static DNS </b>IP Address. 
</div>

<p><b>WINS</b>
<div class="morespace">
The Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) manages each Windows PC’s interaction 
with the Internet. If you use a WINS server, enter that server's IP Address here. Otherwise, leave this blank. <br>&nbsp; </div></td>
